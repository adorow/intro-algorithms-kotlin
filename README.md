Introduction to algorithms in Kotlin
====================================

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code or use the LLVM compiler infrastructure.

[Introduction to algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms) is a very well known book, used as textbook by many universities for teaching algorithms and data structures to its students.

As part of my drive to learn more about Kotlin I decided to start this little project where I will be writing algorithms found in the Third Edition of the book in Kotlin.
The idea is for it to first be a transliteration of the pseudo-algorithms found in the book. And then I'll attempt to use some of the language features to make it more Kotlin-like.

II. Sorting and Order Statistics
==============================================

This part presents several algorithms that solve the sorting problem:

**Input**: A sequence of _n_ numbers \<_a_<sub>1</sub>, _a_<sub>2</sub>, ..., _a_<sub>n</sub>\>.

**Output**: A permutation (reordering) \<_a'_<sub>1</sub>, _a'_<sub>2</sub>, ..., _a'_<sub>_n_</sub>\> of the input sequence such that _a'_<sub>1</sub> ≤ _a'_<sub>2</sub> ≤ ... ≤ _a'_<sub>_n_</sub>.

The input is usually an _n-element_ array. Although it may be represented in some other fashion, such as linked list.

In practice, the numbers being sorted are rarely isolated values. Each value would likely be part of a **_record_**. 
Each record contains a **_key_**, which is the value to be sorted.
The remainder of the record consists of **_satellite data_**, which are usually carried around with the key.
For larger records, we will usually permute pointers instead of the records themselves.

This part of the book will mostly detail more sorting algorithms, extending what has been provided in Chapter 2.

[Chapter 6](2.06.md) introduces the Heapsort algorithm, as well as heaps and priority queues.
[Chapter 7](2.07.md) introduces the Quicksort algorithm.
[Chapter 8](2.08.md) discusses linear time sorting algorithms.
[Chapter 9](2.09.md) talks about medians and order statistics.

I. Foundations
==============================================

The goal of this entire section is to get you thinking in designing and analysing algorithms.
In the words of the authors, it is 
> intended to be a gentle introduction to how we specify algorithms

Many of the strategies for design that are discussed here are used throughout the book.

[Chapter 1](1.01.md) defines what an algorithm is, and also lists a few examples.

[Chapter 2](1.02.md) will describe the first algorithm, which solves the problem of sorting a sequence of _n_ numbers. Describing also what the pseudo-code used is.

[Chapter 3](1.03.md) defines asymptotic notations, which are used to bound algorithm running times. The rest of this chapter will present a mathematical notation, to ensure that the reader's use of the notation matches that of the book.

[Chapter 4](1.04.md) will dive deeper into the divide-and-conquer method, and will give more examples of algorithms that use that approach.

[Chapter 5](1.05.md) introduces probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms.

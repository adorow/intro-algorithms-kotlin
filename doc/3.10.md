Chapter 10. Elementary Data Structures
======================================

This chapter examines the representation of dynamic sets by data structures that use pointers.
The most rudimentary data structures will be defined here: stacks, queues, linked lists and rooted trees.

## Stacks and queues

Stacks and queues are dynamic sets in which the element removed by the delete operation is prespecified.
In a **stack**, the element deleted from the set is the most recently inserted: the stack implements a **last-in, first-out** or **LIFO**, policy.
Similarly, in a **queue** the element deleted is the one present the longest time: the queue implements a **first-in, first-out**, or **FIFO**, policy.

### Stack

In a stack, the _INSERT_ operation is usually called _PUSH_; and the _DELETE_ operation, which does not take any element, is usually called _POP_.
These names are allusions to physical stacks.


**Pseudocode**:
>Stack-Empty(_S_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **if** _S_._top_ == 0  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        **return** TRUE  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **else return** FALSE  

>Push(_S_, _x_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _S_._top_ = _S_._top_ + 1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _S_\[_S_._top_] = _x_  

>Pop(_S_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **if** Stack-Empty(_S_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        **error** "underflow"  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **else** 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        _S_._top_ = _S_._top_ - 1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        **return** _S_\[_S_._top_+ 1]

### Queue

In a queue, the _INSERT_ operation is called _ENQUEUE_; and the _DELETE_ operation is called _DEQUEUE_.
The FIFO property of the queue causes it to operate like a line of customers waiting to pay.
A queue has a **head** and a **tail**. 
When an element is enqueued, it takes a place at the _tail_ of the queue. 
The element dequeued is always the one at the _head_ of the queue. 


**Pseudocode**:
>Enqueue(_Q_, _x_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _Q_.\[_Q_._tail_] = _x_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **if** _Q_._tail_ == _Q_._length_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        _Q_._tail_ = 1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **else** _Q_._tail_ = _Q_._tail_ + 1  

>Dequeue(_Q_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _x_ = _Q_\[_Q_._head_]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **if** _Q_._head_ == _Q_._length_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        _Q_._head_ = 1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **else** _Q_._head_ = _Q_._head_ + 1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **return** _x_

### Linked List

A linked list is a data structure in which the objects are arranged in linear order.
Unlike an array, its order is not determined by an index, but by a pointer in each object.
Each element of a _**doubly linked list**_ _L_ is an object with an attribute _key_ and two other pointer attributes: _next_ and _prev_.
The object may also contain other satellite data.

A list may have several forms.
It may be singly linked or doubly linked, it may be sorted or not, and it may be circular or not.
If a list is _**single linked**_, we omit the _prev_ pointer in each element.
If a list is _**sorted**_, the linear order of the list corresponds to the linear order of keys stored in elements of the list; the minimum element is the head, and the maximum element is the tail.
If the list is _**unsorted**_, the elements can appear in any order.
In a _**circular**_ list, the _prev_ pointer of the head of the list points to the tail, and the _next_ pointer of the tail points to the head.

**Pseudocode**:
>List-Search(_L_, _k_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _x_ = _L_._head_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **while** _x_ ≠ NIL and _x_._key_ ≠ _k_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        _x_ = _x_._next_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **return** _x_  

>List-Insert(_L_, _x_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _x_._next_ = _L_._head_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **if** _L_._head_ ≠ NIL  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        _L_._head_._prev_= _x_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _L_._head_ = _x_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _x_._prev_ = NIL  

>List-Delete(_L_, _x_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **if** _x_._prev_ ≠ NIL  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        _x_._prev_._next_ = _x_._next_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **else** _L_._head_ = _x_._next_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **if** _x_._next_ ≠ NIL  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        _x_._next_._prev_ = _x_._prev_  

**In Kotlin**: [Implementation](../src/main/kotlin/chapter10/LinkedList.kt) and [Tests](../src/test/kotlin/chapter10/LinkedListTest.kt).

The code for List-Delete can be made simpler with the use of **sentinels**. 
A **sentinel** is a dummy object that allows us to simplify the code by ignoring the boundary conditions at the head and tail of the list.
Wherever we have a reference to NIL in list code, we replace it by a reference to _L_._nil_.
This change turns a regular doubly linked list into a **circular, doubly linked list with a sentinel**, in which the sentinel _L_._nil_ lies between the head and tail.
The attribute _L_._nil_._next_ points to the head of the list, and _L_._nil_._prev_ points to the tail.
Since _L_._nil_._next_ points to the head, we can eliminate the attribute _L_._head_ altogether, replacing its references by _L_._nil_._next_.

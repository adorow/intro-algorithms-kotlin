Chapter 10. Elementary Data Structures
======================================

This chapter examines the representation of dynamic sets by data structures that use pointers.
The most rudimentary data structures will be defined here: stacks, queues, linked lists and rooted trees.

## Stacks and queues

Stacks and queues are dynamic sets in which the element removed by the delete operation is prespecified.
In a **stack**, the element deleted from the set is the most recently inserted: the stack implements a **last-in, first-out** or **LIFO**, policy.
Similarly, in a **queue** the element deleted is the one present the longest time: the queue implements a **first-in, first-out**, or **FIFO**, policy.

## Stack

In a stack, the _INSERT_ operation is usually called _PUSH_; and the _DELETE_ operation, which does not take any element, is usually called _POP_.
These names are allusions to physical stacks.


**Pseudocode**:
>Stack-Empty(_S_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **if** _S_._top_ == 0  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        **return** TRUE  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **else return** FALSE  

>Push(_S_, _x_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _S_._top_ = _S_._top_ + 1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _S_\[_S_._top_] = _x_  

>Pop(_S_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **if** Stack-Empty(_S_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        **error** "underflow"  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **else** 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        _S_._top_ = _S_._top_ - 1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        **return** _S_\[_S_._top_+ 1]

## Queue

In a queue, the _INSERT_ operation is called _ENQUEUE_; and the _DELETE_ operation is called _DEQUEUE_.
The FIFO property of the queue causes it to operate like a line of customers waiting to pay.
A queue has a **head** and a **tail**. 
When an element is enqueued, it takes a place at the _tail_ of the queue. 
The element dequeued is always the one at the _head_ of the queue. 


**Pseudocode**:
>Enqueue(_Q_, _x_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _Q_.\[_Q_._tail_] = _x_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **if** _Q_._tail_ == _Q_._length_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        _Q_._tail_ = 1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **else** _Q_._tail_ = _Q_._tail_ + 1  

>Dequeue(_Q_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _x_ = _Q_\[_Q_._head_]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **if** _Q_._head_ == _Q_._length_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        _Q_._head_ = 1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **else** _Q_._head_ = _Q_._head_ + 1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **return** _x_

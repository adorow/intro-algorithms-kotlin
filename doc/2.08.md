Chapter 8. Sorting in Linear Time
=================================

Until this point, multiple algorithms were introduced that can sort _n_ numbers in _O_(_n_ lg _n_) time.
These algorithms share an interesting property: _the sorted order they determine is based only on comparisons between the input elements_.
Such algorithms are called **_comparison sorts_**, and all algorithms introduced so far are comparison sorts.

This chapter will introduce three new sorting algorithms: counting sort, radix sort and bucket sort - that run in linear time.
These algorithms use operations other than comparisons to determine the sorted order.

## Counting sort

**_Counting sort_** assumes that each of the _n_ input elements is an integer in the range 0 to _k_, for some integer _k_.  

Counting sort determines, for each input element _x_, the number of elements less than _x_.
It uses this information to place element _x_ directly into its position in the output array.

In the code for counting sort, we assume that the input is an array _A_\[1.._n_], and thus _A_._length_ = _n_.
We require two other arrays: the array _B_\[1.._n_] holds the sorted output, and the array _C_\[1.._k_] provides temporary working storage.


**Pseudocode**:
>Counting-Sort(_A_, _B_, _k_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    let _C_\[0.._k_] be an array  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **for** _i_ = 0 **to** _k_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        _C_\[_i_] = 0  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **for** _j_ = 1 **to** _A_._length_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        _C_\[_A_\[_j_]] = _C_\[_A_\[_j_]] + 1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    // _C_\[_i_] now contains the number of elements equal to _i_.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **for** _i_ = 1 **to** _k_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        _C_\[_i_] = _C_\[_i_] + _C_\[_i_ - 1]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    // _C_\[_i_] now contains the number of elements less than or equal to _i_.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **for** _j_ = _A_._length_ **downto** 1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        _B_\[_C_\[_A_\[_j_]]] = _A_\[_j_]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        _C_\[_A_\[_j_]] = _C_\[_A_\[_j_]] - 1

Chapter 14. Augmenting Data Structures
======================================

Some engineering situations require no more than a "textbook" data structure, but many others require a bit of creativity.
Only in rare situations will you need to create an entirely new type of data structure though.
More often, it will be suffice to augment aa textbook data structure by storing additional information in it.
It is not always simple though, since the added information must be updated and maintained by the ordinary operations on the data structure.

### Dynamic order statistics
[Chapter 9][chapter9] introduced the notion of an order statistic.
Specifically, the _i_ th order statistic of a set of _n_ elements, where _i_ ∈ {1, 2, ..., _n_}, is simply the element in the set with the _i_th smallest key.
In this section, we will see how to modify red-black trees so that we can determine any order statistic for a dynamic set in _O_(lg _n_) time.
We shall see how to compute the **_rank_** of an element - its position in the linear order of the set - in _O_(lg _n_) time.

An **order-statistic tree** _T_ is simply a red-black tree with additional information stored in each node. 
Besides the usual red-black tree attributes _x_._key_, _x_._color_, _x_._p_, _x_._left_, and _x_._right_ in a node _x_, we have another attribute _x_._size_.
This attribute contains the number of (internal) nodes in the subtree rooted at _x_ (including _x_ itself), that is, the size of the subtree.
If we define the size of the sentinel to be 0 (that is, _T_._nil_._size_ to be 0), then we have the identity:

>_x_._size_ = _x_._left_._size_ + _x_._right_._size_ + 1

We do not require keys to be distinct in an order-statistic tree.
In the presence of equal keys, the above notion is not well defined.
We remove this ambiguity for an order-statistic tree by defining the rank of an element as the position at which it would be printed in an inorder walk of the tree.

#### Retrieving an element with a given rank

First, let's examine the implementation of two order-statistic queries that use this additional information.
We begin with an operation that retrieves an element with a given rank.
The procedure OS-Select(_x_, _i_) returns a pointer to the node containing the _i_ th smallest key in the subtree rooted at _x_.
To find the node with the _i_ th smallest key in an order-statistic tree _T_, we call OS-Select(_T_._root_, _i_).

**Pseudocode**:
>OS-Select(_x_, _i_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _r_ = _x_._left_._size_ + 1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **if** _i_ = _r_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        **return** _x_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **elseif** _i_ < _r_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        **return** OS-Select(_x_._left_, _i_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **return** OS-Select(_x_._right_, _i_ - _r_)  

**In Kotlin**: [Implementation](../src/main/kotlin/chapter14/OrderStatisticTree.kt) and [Tests](../src/test/kotlin/chapter14/OrderStatisticTreeTest.kt).

Because each recursive call goes down one level in the order-statistic tree, the total time for OS-Select is at worst proportional to the height of the tree.
Since the tree is a red-black tree, its height is _O_(lg _n_), where _n_ is the number of nodes.
Thus the running time of OS-Select is _O_(lg _n_) for a dynamic set of _n_ elements.

#### Determining the rank of an element

Given a pointer to a node _x_ in an order-statistic tree _T_, the procedure OS-Rank returns the position of _x_ in the linear order determined by an inorder tree walk of _T_.

**Pseudocode**:
>OS-Rank(_T_, _x_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _r_ = _x_._left_._size_ + 1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _y_ = _x_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **while** _y_ ≠ _T_._root_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        **if** _y_ == _y_._p_._right_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;            _r_ = _r_ + _y_._p_._left_._size_ + 1  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        _y_ == _y_._p_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    **return** _r_  

**In Kotlin**: [Implementation](../src/main/kotlin/chapter14/OrderStatisticTree.kt) and [Tests](../src/test/kotlin/chapter14/OrderStatisticTreeTest.kt).

Since each iteration of the while loop takes _O_(1) time, and _y_ goes up one level in the tree with each iteration, the running time of OS-Rank is at worst proportional to the height of the tree: _O_(lg _n_) on an _n_-node order-statistic tree.

#### Maintaining subtree sizes

Given the _size_ attribute in each node, OS-Select and OS-Rank can quickly compute order-statistic information.
But unless we can efficiently maintain these attributes within the basic modifying operations on red-black trees, our work will have been for naught.
We shall now show how to maintain subtree sizes for both insertion and deletion without affecting the asymptotic running time of either operation.

Insertion into a red-black tree consists of two phases.
The first phase goes down the tree from the root, inserting the new node as a child of an existing node.
The second phase goes up the tree, changing colors and performing rotations to maintain the red-black properties.

To maintain the subtree sizes in the first phase, we simply increment _x_._size_ for each node _x_ on the simple path traversed from the root down toward the leaves.
The new node added gets a _size_ of 1.
Since there are _O_(lg _n_) nodes on the traversed path, the additional cost of maintaining the _size_ attributes is _O_(lg _n_).

In the second phase, the only structural changes to the underlying red-black tree are caused by rotations, of which there are at most two.
Moreover, a rotation is a local operation: only two nodes have their _size_ invalidated.
Referring to the code in [Chapter 13][chapter13] for Left-Rotate(_T_, _x_), we add the following lines:

>Left-Rotate(_T_, _x_)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    ...  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _y_._size_ = _x_._size_  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    _x_._size_ = _x_._left_._size_ + _x_._right_._size_ + 1  

**In Kotlin**: [Implementation](../src/main/kotlin/chapter14/OrderStatisticTree.kt) and [Tests](../src/test/kotlin/chapter14/OrderStatisticTreeTest.kt).

The change to Right-Rotate is symmetric.

Since at most two rotations are performed during insertion, we spend only _O_(1) additional time updating _size_ attributes in the second phase.
Thus, the total time for insertion into an _n_-node order-statistic tree is _O_(lg _n_), which is asymptotically the same as s for an ordinary red-black tree.

Deletion from a red-black tree also consists of two phases: the first operates on the underlying search tree, and the second causes at most three rotations and otherwise performs no structural changes.
The first phase either removes the node _y_ from the tree or moves upward it within the tree.
To update the subtree sizes, we simply traverse a simple path from node _y_ (starting from its original position within the tree) up to the root, decrementing the _size_ attribute of each node on the path.
Since this path has length _O_(lg _n_) in an _n_-node red-black tree, the additional time spent maintaining _size_ attributes in the first phase is _O_(lg _n_).
We handle the _O_(1) rotations in the second phase of deletion in the same manner as for insertion.
Thus, both insertion and deletion, including maintaining the _size_ attributes, take _O_(lg _n_) time for n _n_-node order-statistic tree.
